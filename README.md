# 435-Project-2

Part 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------
The main method will run tests.

The pdf shows the outputs of the program.
Randomly it will throw a NullPointerException, in that case, just run it again after 1 minute.

This program allows users to create a Graph Object which can be used to help create a random and unweighted graph with n Nodes.
The Graph Object also allows the user to create a graph that is a linked list.

The GraphSearch class allows users to run a DFS iteratively or recursively.
BFT iteratively or recursively

Part 2-------------------------------------------------------------------

DirectedGraph:

  Creates Random DAG graph iteratively
  
  Does not implement Kahns
  
  Can do mDFS
  

WeightedGraph:

  Creates Random Weighted Graph
  
  Creates Weighted Linked List Graph
  
  Dijkstras is NOT fully functioning
  
    Currently runs infinite loop, there is an unfound bug
    
GridGraph:

  Creates Grid
  
  Creates Random Grid Graph
  
  A* is NOT fully functioning
  
    Currently runs infinite loop, there is an unfound bug
