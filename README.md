The main method will run tests.

The pdf shows the outputs of the program.
Randomly it will throw a NullPointerException, in that case, just run it again after 1 minute.

The Graph Object also allows the user to create a graph that is a linked list.

The GraphSearch class allows users to run a DFS iteratively or recursively.
BFT iteratively or recursively
